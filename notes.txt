- Try node types validity in playground
- Try deno types validity in playground
- Increment all versions
    - package

    - deno's mod.ts
    - README installation
- Dry run publishing NPM module
- Publish NPM module
- Try to use the deno using unpkg (https://unpkg.com/opencv-wasm@<version>/mod.ts), see if the type is working.
